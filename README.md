#Turntable Remix#
Turntable Remix is currently only available for Chrome, however a port to Firefox has been planned.

I'm currently in the process of rewriting the base of Remix as the current version was a rewrite done in a day, needless to say things came out really sloppy which lead to stupid bugs and inefficiency. Thank you all for the motivation to continue and make Remix better altogether.

Hopefully this update fixes the loading issues. If you continue having problems or have something to say you can reach me at overra@gmail.com on AIM or GTalk or [@overra](http://twitter.com/overra) on twitter.
